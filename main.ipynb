    "The objective of this project is to design, train, and evaluate a Deep Learning model capable of solving a **Multi-task Learning** problem. We are provided with a custom dataset containing **3,000 samples**. Each sample consists of a `(32, 32)` input matrix (interpreted as a grayscale image) associated with three distinct targets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Target A:** Classification (10 classes, integers 0-9).\n",
    "* **Target B:** Classification (32 classes, integers 0-31).\n",
    "* **Target C:** Regression (Real value in range $[0, 1]$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Methodology\n",
    "Our goal is to build a **single unified Neural Network** (likely based on CNN) that predicts all three components simultaneously. This approach allows the model to learn shared feature representations from the input images before branching out to specific tasks.\n",

    "The notebook is structured as follows:\n",
    "1.  **Data Inspection:** Analyzing shapes and distributions.\n",
    "2.  **Model Design:** Creating a multi-head architecture.\n",

    "**Residual Block Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core building unit of the proposed model is a residual block, which consists of two consecutive 3×3 convolutional layers followed by batch normalization. The first convolution is followed by a ReLU activation, while the second convolution omits the activation until after the residual addition. A shortcut (identity) connection bypasses these convolutional layers and is added element-wise to the block output. This skip connection allows the network to preserve low-level features while learning higher-level representations, improving both convergence speed and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "When spatial resolution or channel dimensionality changes, the shortcut path is adapted using a 1×1 convolution with appropriate stride. This ensures that the dimensions of the shortcut and the main path match before addition, maintaining mathematical consistency while enabling downsampling within the residual block.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CIFAR-Style ResNet Trunk**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model adopts a CIFAR-style ResNet design, which is specifically tailored for small input images (32×32 pixels). Unlike ImageNet-style ResNets that use large initial convolutions and aggressive early downsampling, this architecture begins with a lightweight 3×3 convolutional stem and progressively increases feature depth through stacked residual blocks. Downsampling is performed gradually using stride-2 convolutions inside residual blocks, preserving spatial information critical for low-resolution inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trunk is organized into three stages with increasing numbers of filters (32, 64, and 128), allowing the network to capture hierarchical features ranging from local textures to more abstract patterns. This design balances representational power with computational efficiency and reduces the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global Feature Aggregation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the convolutional trunk, Global Average Pooling is applied to collapse the spatial dimensions of the feature maps. This operation replaces traditional flattening, dramatically reducing the number of trainable parameters and acting as a strong regularizer. Global pooling forces the network to encode spatially invariant, semantically meaningful features, which is particularly beneficial for preventing overfitting on small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shared Representation and Regularization**\n",
    "\n",
    "The pooled features are passed through a shared fully connected layer that produces a compact latent representation used by all task-specific heads. Batch normalization and ReLU activation stabilize training and improve non-linearity, while dropout is applied to further reduce overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons during training. This shared representation enables efficient multi-task learning, allowing the network to leverage common features across different prediction objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Head Output Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture employs three specialized output heads, each optimized for a different task. Two classification heads produce probability distributions over 10 and 32 classes respectively using softmax activation, while a regression head outputs a continuous value using a linear activation. Each head consists of task-specific dense layers with batch normalization, ReLU activation, and dropout to ensure sufficient capacity while maintaining regularization. This design allows the model to learn both shared and task-specific representations effectively within a unified framework."

Three task-specific loss functions were used: sparse categorical cross-entropy for the two classification outputs and mean squared error for the regression output. To balance multi-task learning, loss weights of 1.0, 1.0, and 0.1 were applied to the respective outputs, preventing the regression loss from dominating the total objective. Model performance was monitored using accuracy for classification tasks and mean absolute error for the regression task, providing interpretable and task-appropriate evaluation metrics."

    "To improve training stability and convergence, a ReduceLROnPlateau callback was applied. This mechanism automatically reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.5 when validation loss fails to improve for 20 consecutive epochs. By adaptively lowering the learning rate, the optimizer is encouraged to escape plateaus and refine the solution during later training stages, while preventing premature convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these callbacks provide effective regularization and optimization control, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving overall model robustness. The combination of extended training duration, adaptive learning rate adjustment, and validation-based checkpointing ensures that the model converges efficiently while maintaining strong generalization performance."

    "The testing results highlight clear differences in performance across the three prediction tasks, reflecting the varying levels of difficulty and data complexity associated with each output head. For **Target A (digits 0–9)**, the model achieves an overall accuracy of 37%, with macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1-scores all around 0.35. Performance varies notably across individual classes. Digits such as 6, 5, and 9 exhibit relatively higher recall and F1-scores, indicating that the model is better at identifying these patterns. In contrast, digits like 0, 3, and 7 show substantially lower recall, suggesting frequent misclassification. The confusion matrix further confirms that several digits are confused with visually similar classes, which is expected in low-resolution grayscale inputs and limited training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **Target B (32-class classification)**, performance is considerably weaker, with an overall accuracy of only 5% and macro-averaged F1-score of 0.03. Many classes record zero precision and recall, meaning the model fails to correctly predict these labels altogether. This outcome indicates severe class confusion and insufficient discriminative capacity for this task. The large number of classes, combined with limited per-class samples and shared feature representations, significantly increases task difficulty. The confusion matrix reveals widespread misclassification, with predictions concentrated in a small subset of classes rather than evenly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **Target C (regression)** demonstrates more stable behavior. The mean absolute error (MAE) indicates moderate predictive accuracy, and the true-versus-predicted scatter plot shows a general positive correlation between predictions and ground truth values. While predictions deviate from the ideal diagonal line, especially near the extremes, the regression head benefits from shared learned features and a smoother loss landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results suggest that the model learns coarse visual representations sufficient for simpler classification and regression tasks, but struggles with fine-grained multi-class discrimination. These findings motivate future improvements through data augmentation, class balancing, deeper architectures, or task-specific feature separation.\n"
